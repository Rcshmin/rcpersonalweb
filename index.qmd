Hello and welcome to my personal website, your one stop shop for viewing my self-indulgent display of personal projects. As of now, I am a fourth year student studying a Bachelor of Actuarial Studies with a Bachelor of Applied Finance. Boring, right? Some of my interests include mathematics, data science and cricket (yes, the sportüèè). On this website, you will find some projects and other code related endeavors I have worked on in my downtime. Most of them are a from scratch implementation of a data science algorithm in R. Take a look if you are interested.
