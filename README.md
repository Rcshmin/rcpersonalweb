# rc personal website

This is repository dedicated to hosting a static site serving as my portfolio/personal website for projects/coding I do in my free time. 
It is generated using **Quarto**, and replaces my previous personal website *The Oracle*, which was made using *blogdown*.

There were a few reasons for this 

* Blogdown themes introduced a lot of CSS and JS files which were hard to edit. This made customizing my personal website quite difficult. These themes were also subject to compatibility issues as well
* Quarto is much simpler and easier to navigate
* Quarto allows for code in Python and other languages
* Quarto does not suffer from the same compatibility and maintenance issues as blogdown

Note that much of the posts generated on the static site have code sourced from my *datasciencefromscratch* repository.
